The company’s total addressable market. In other words, how big the market is for its products. Cramer also likes to know where it sits in the pecking order. Nike is the dominant player in footwear and number two in apparel. \n\n3. Are there any catalysts that can power the stock higher? Nike has several catalysts, like the Summer Olympics. \n\n4. Other ways to look into the future. Nike has a company-specific key metric called future orders, which allows customers to order merchandise six months ahead.\n\n5. The company’s ability to pass costs onto the customers. Nike made it clear in the conference call that it had no trouble passing on raw costs through price increases, Cramer said. \n\n6. It’s important to understand the geographic breakdown of the business. Nike’s fastest growing geographies are emerging markets, which is up 26 percent year-over-year. China is up 28 percent and the U.S. is up 21 percent. Western Europe and Japan are still challenging environments, but they’re offset by the strength elsewhere.\n\n7. Wall Street loves accelerating revenue growth. Nike has this across multiple product categories in both developed and developing markets.\n\n8. Inventory. When companies with retail components have too much inventory, it can be a problem since they’ll have to discount the older products before bringing in a new product. Nike’s unit inventory growth outpaced its sales growth, but since absolute unit levels have \"plateaued,\" Cramer is not concerned. \n\n9.

Is it extended on a technical basis?\n\nNo. 5: Should you wait until it comes down a bit more? What's the harm?\n\nNo. 6: What do you know about this stock that others are missing? Is your instinct to buy based on general knowledge, and you're working on a herd mentality? Have you listened to the conference calls and done the research, or are you flying blind?\n\nNo. 7: What do you actually know about the company and sector? Do you have personal knowledge? Do you know how the cloud works, what stock trades with what, or where it lies in the sector’s food chain?\n\nNo. 8: Do you like this stock more than others you own and why?

Let’s talk about this and other stock market news** [BANNER](https://ibb.co/Y2M1dQ8)\n\nHey everyone and Welcome, let’s start with a recap of the stock markets yesterday \n\nAs we saw a continuing of the same market trading as Monday as the Dow gained almost 1% [CHART](https://ibb.co/1z2DXMT), while the Nasdaq was punished again down more than 1,3% [CHART](https://ibb.co/k8hJGQf) while the broader stock market in the SP finished flat for the day. [CHART](https://ibb.co/bR3yw5L)\n\nWe saw 2 thirds of the market advancing with 77 new highs and 15 new lows while the volume continued to be above average for the second straight day [CHART](https://ibb.co/jfMb5G8) as investors are shifting portfolios more to the value plays. As we saw energy lead the way with 61% of energy companies advancing more than 2% as well as more than 50% of companies from consumer staples and industrials also advancing more than 2% for the day while the laggards were consumer discretionary and technology with more than 20% of the companies being down more than 2% for the day [CHART](https://ibb.co/LhjWFR0)  with many internet retails companies selling off again like fiver jd.com , Etsy eBay, Shopify and others including Amazon. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/fxzG9m5)\n\nThe market was led again by small caps as well as value and high dividend plays while growth and momentum companies were down again. [CHART](https://ibb.co/9HcqktG)\n\nHere is the heat map for the S&P500  [MAP](https://ibb.co/DG8f1JW) where you can see most of the big tech companies as well of most of the credit services were down. While the broader market map shows the transition to energy plays as well as industrials [MAP](https://ibb.co/vz48M8g). Whereas tech companies like Netflix, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft extended losses from Monday this dragged the Nasdaq Index down.\n\nThe volatility index maintained steady at the 25 level slightly lower than yesterday but keeping that support line that will be maintained for a period in my opinion [VIX](https://ibb.co/3MmwnjF) with the VIX withstanding the huge market volume from Monday, as early data from Reuters shows that there were nearly 2 trillion $ being exchanged [NEWS](https://ibb.co/xMNCPNz) as value stocks had the best one-day performance against growth stocks ever in the US as brokers worldwide had problems handling this huge volume of trading with companies like TD Ameritrade, Fidelity, Charles Schwab experiencing issues. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/Xx1dwpG)\n\nSo, democrats have clinched House control but they really disappointed expectations as they were expecting to gain even more seats as much as 15 but this has moved to a loss of seats that stand at 6 and counting at the moment. This has completed 2 thirds of the best results the stock market was expecting with only the Senate being up for grabs at the beginning of January. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/qCkzY3x)\n\nToday there are not many events in the economic calendar as only Mortgage Applications number are expected, as the bond markets are also closed for Veterans day, stocks will see most of the trading today.\n\nYesterday Apple launched the first MacBook laptops with the in-house built processor, this will move closer the Mac and iPhone as they will both have the Apple processors from now, cutting they tie the company had with Intel that bad provided them for almost 15 years. The new Macs seem to have huge improvements in performance and battery life. This will likely be a boost to the addressable market of the Macs as they will address the people who need big performance in they’re computers as well as people who are looking for good cheap computer as the new Mac Mini desktop is 100$ cheaper than the previous version. This will be a more than 15 billion addressable market for Apple as they continue to improve products and services all the time. [APPLE NEWS](https://ibb.co/RHsDQx6)\n\nBoeing announced that they have lost another 12 orders for the 737 MAX and delivered just 13 aircrafts, the delivery number is down from 20 aircrafts in the same month from a year ago. So they have only delivered 111 aircrafts this year a huge decrease from 321 just a year ago in the same period. [BOEING NEWS](https://ibb.co/HTZSB94)\n\nThe stock has seen a surge of more than 30% as people are rushing back to own the stocks after positive news on the ending of the 737 max grounding as well as the vaccine news.\n\nThis was also helped by the fact that the just secured worth almost 10 billion $ with the Air Force. [BOEING CONTRACT](https://ibb.co/6vRFGjF)\n\nAlibaba just announced that orders made on its e-commerce platform during the Singles Day event have exceeded 56 billion $ by today as consumers are still splashing out money on buying products online. Singles day is the world’s biggest sales event eclipsing both Black Friday and Cyber Monday in the US combined as it stretches over 4 main days this year. They have received more than 16 times the orders that Amazon received last month in its two-day Prime event. This are finally some good news for the company as it has lost almost 76 billion $ of it’s market value after the suspension of Ant Group IPO which they own about a third of. I believe this will be a great opportunity to buy the stocks as it is way down from its highs. Ant Group will eventually file and have they’re IPO in the next year which will boost the stock up once again even if it will be at a much lower valuation for the company. [ALIBABA NEWS](https://ibb.co/JFBvPV7)\n\nSome other news interesting news is that Airbnb has delayed the documents release for the IPO, as they decided to delay these more from the US elections. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/0JKW0wD)\n\nAlso, Uber is expected to close a deal worth more than 2,5 billion $ after the DOJ has cleared the way [NEWS](https://ibb.co/Tkbx1FN) \n\nWhile Ford is moving more and more to address the EV market as they are expected to release a lot of EV models starting next year.  [NEWS](https://ibb.co/qxNmdyT)\n\nWhile the jobs openings from September has seen a revision that moves it closer to the 6,5 million that where expected as the job openings rate was more than double the quits rate. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/zFrrpsZ)\n\nThis as the small business optimism was flat last month a lower value than was expected but the same as September [NEWS](https://ibb.co/RjgKNLw) pretty much in line with TD’s Investor movement that was flat also in the last month. [INVESTOR SENTIMENT](https://ibb.co/X2fv359)\n\nSo, I believe great times are ahead as do many of the investors as a post-election poll shows that over 60% expect a positive return next year. But be aware any derailments or delays of the vaccines may bring more volatility to the stock market. [POLL](https://ibb.co/SxqtQSL)\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

For Q3 Palantir stated that “Revenue: $278 million to $280 million, representing year over year growth of 46% to 47%.” Please note that since Palantir direct listed, they are allowed to make forward looking statements where as if they went with a traditional IPO, they would not be allowed to make such a statement until their first earnings.\n\nThis is where things get interesting and why I truly believe that Palantir will exceed revenue by a large position. \n\nOn September 29th (1 day before they direct list and 7 days after they provided future guidance), Palantir was awarded a US army contract for Research bf Development of the Army Research Laboratory. This contract was worth $91,176,844 million. See excerpt below.\n\n\n“Palantir, Washington, D.C., was awarded a $91,176,844 firm-fixed-price contract for general research and development support of the Army Research Laboratory.

Fiscal 2020 research, development, test, and evaluation (Army) funds in the amount of $44,154,209 were obligated at the time of the award.  The U.S. Army Contracting Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, is the contracting activity (W911QX-20-C-0041).”\n\nThe interesting thing about that contract is the following.\n\n“... funds in the amount of $44,154,209 were obligated at the time of the award.”\n\nBased on this, Palantir should have been able to book an additional $44 million in revenue since it was awarded to them on September 29th, one day before the end of their Q3. \n\nI also do not believe Palantir included this additional $44M in revenue in their projected financial forecast they released on Sept 22nd as it would have looked extremely bad to be short $44M from your projection.\n\nPlease let me know what your thoughts are on this. I may be completely wrong but nonetheless, thought it was interesting. \n\nCheers!",

      "selftext": "Adobe Inc. said it will acquire Workfront Inc. for $1.5 billion to add a collaboration tool to its marketing software, providing expanded offerings during a pandemic that has forced companies to maintain productivity while employees work from home.\n\nThe deal is expected to close sometime from December to February 2021, San Jose, California-based Adobe said Monday in a statement. Workfront, based in Lehi, Utah, will take its 3,000 corporate customers and 1 million users to the software maker best known for Photoshop. Bloomberg earlier reported that the acquisition could come as soon as Monday.\n\nAdobe has been a leader in the graphics and visual software industry for decades, but hasn’t offered collaboration tools. The company’s shares, which have climbed 43% this year, declined 4.8% to $471.14 at the close in New York.\n\nAfter recent stumbles, the acquisition is Adobe’s biggest effort to reorient its Experience Cloud division, which includes marketing, advertising and analytics software, toward areas that are growing. The company has sought to make its creative and business applications more collaborative, so that teams can more easily work together on projects. During the Covid-19 pandemic, businesses have found it essential to have better communication among colleagues working remotely. Adobe has curtailed some of its advertising services that had a low profit margin and said it had a new strategy of catering to customers that use multiple Experience Cloud tools.\n\nUnlike other makers of work productivity tools, including Asana Inc. and Atlassian Inc., which owns Trello, Workfront is focused on marketers, who use the software every day to “manage content, plan and track marketing campaigns and execute complex workflows across teams,” Adobe said in the statement. Marketers are also major clients for Adobe, which already integrates several of its products with Workfront’s offering.\n\nWorkfront will be Adobe’s fifth-biggest acquisition, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe purchase marks the first major action by Anil Chakravarthy, an executive vice president, who joined Adobe in January after serving as chief executive officer of Informatica LLC. Chakravarthy said in an interview that Adobe and Workfront have more than 1,000 mutual clients.\n\n“Every customer that we talk to is investing more and more in digital marketing,” he said. “They want to get more efficiency out of digital marketing efforts. They want to get more agility and speed into their digital marketing efforts. As the investments grow the amount of work involved in marketing, is growing exponentially and they really need a system to be able to manage work so they get the right efficiency, productivity and collaboration across their teams.”\n\nWorkfront has seen interest in its software increase during the pandemic as marketing companies seek to get more insight into which employees are working on what part of a project, Alex Shootman, Workfront’s chief executive officer, said in an interview. The Adobe acquisition, he said, is an “awesome outcome.”\n\n“When you have an opportunity to work with the company that CMOs rely on to run their business, which is Adobe, and you’re a company like Workfront, that takes us forward years in terms of what we would have been able to accomplish on our own,” Shootman said.\n\nShootman will continue to run the Workfront team and will report to Chakravarthy when the acquisition is completed.\n\nWorkfront has raised about $100 million to date, according to PitchBook. Last year, W Capital Partners, Susquehanna Growth Equity and AllianceBernstein’s AB Private Credit Investors acquired a minority stake in the company after buying out some of its investors for $280 million. It’s also backed by OpenView, Greenspring Associates and JMI Equity.\n\nThe company, formerly known as AtTask, was founded in 2001 by Scott Johnson, who is now its chairman. Workfront said last year that it had generated $200 million in revenue in 2018.\n\n[Source](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-09/adobe-said-to-be-in-talks-to-acquire-workfront-for-1-5-billion)",

I would like some input in this decision. \n\n\n\nAnother stock I like is VCF. They own north face. Vans and Timberlands as also just bought Streetwear fashion giant Supreme.

I also heard they want to buy Tiffany.  What you guys think  is it a solid buy? I’m thinking of putting $2000 in LVMH and just let the money stack up. LVMH is a very strong brand I don’t see them losing anytime soon. I would like some input in this decision. </p>\n\n<p>Another stock I like is VCF. They own north face. Vans and Timberlands as also just bought Streetwear fashion giant Supreme. I’m sure VCF should be a hit also. What you guys think?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
